## Introduction
This application is a spring boot application that was created so that the user can conveniently find the books he needs according to the necessary parameters (author, price, title, category).
This project includes many different technologies for fast and reliable operation of the application.
Next, we will familiarize ourselves with each part of this application in more detail.
## Technologies used
This application includes the following list of technologies:
- Spring Data JPA: Ensuring streamlined and effective data retrieval and persistence.
- Spring Security: Enhancing application security and safeguarding user data.
- MapStruct: Simplifying and optimizing the process of mapping between DTOs and entities.
- Docker: Facilitating containerization for simplified deployment and scalability.
- OpenAPI: Enabling comprehensive documentation of our RESTful APIs, offering explicit and in-depth insights into available resources, request structures, and response formats.
- Liquibase: Employed for the management and versioning of database schemas, simplifying schema modifications and ensuring uniform data structure across diverse environments.
- Swagger: Seamlessly navigate and engage with our API using the user-friendly Swagger documentation.
    For a more comprehensive overview of the functions and capabilities of these controllers, please refer to the "Features" section for an in-depth understanding.
## API Functionalities
Within our Online Book Store project, we have meticulously adhered to REST (Representational State Transfer) principles when architecting our controllers. These controllers serve as pivotal components responsible for managing HTTP requests and responses.
- AuthenticationController: This controller manages requests for user registration and login, which can be executed through either email and password or a JWT token.
- BookController: This controller is dedicated to receiving and managing requests related to adding, updating, retrieving, and searching for books.
- CategoryController: Here, you can find the handling of requests for adding, updating, and retrieving categories, as well as fetching all books within a specific category.
- ShoppingCartController: Within this controller, you can request actions such as adding, deleting, and updating books within the shopping cart, as well as retrieving the user's shopping cart.
- OrderController: This controller is responsible for handling requests related to creating and retrieving orders, as well as updating the status of orders.
